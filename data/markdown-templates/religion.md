## Prayer/service

- Worship places: The religion needs to have a place to worship, places for the religious leaders and some followers to live and work and other buildings and structures to make their presence known. These may take the form of simple churches, ornate basilicas or mosques or temples, hidden monasteries, roadside shrines or prominent statues. Depending on the religion's popularity in a given area these structures may be frequent reminders or perhaps there is nothing in the area.

- Worship services: How and when and where do the followers worship a god or gods in the religion? Do they meet at a church once a week? Do they have to perform a private prayer several times a day? Are the services centered around a sacrifice or singing or dutiful recitation of some sacred scriptures?


# Structure
## Organization

How are the religion or deity's followers organized?

In some cases (particularly for lawful deities) it may be important to have a strict hierarchy. In other cases a hierarchy except in the loosest sense would be inappropriate as in the case of some nature gods. Another possibility is that the religion is fractured where there are many different groups that all worship the same religion or deity, but they have different approaches or conflicts over portions of scripture.

## Reputation

## Worshipers

Based on the domains the religion influences and the religion's nature so far, who would be part of this religion or worship each god in the pantheon? For example, if the god's domains are water and travel, obviously sailors will likely worship the god. How will this impact the religion? Many of the god's priests will have skills related to sailing. Many of the god's temples will be near the docks of port cities. The religion may be spread throughout a large area. Etc.

## Obligations

What must the religion's followers and especially its leaders do? There may be some regular, daily requirements such as reading a scripture each day or never eating a forbidden food. There may be less frequent requirements such as performing service to others one day each week or month or one week each year. There may be annual obligations such as fasting for a period of time in recognition or sacrifice of some religious event or undergoing some missionary service. Missionary service may also be required for an extended period of time at one point during a person's lifetime. Visiting a sacred place is another possible once in a lifetime obligation.
